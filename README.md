**Assignments for Neuroscience of Learning, Memory, and Cognition at Sharif University of Technology, taught by Dr. Hamid Aghajan**

### Content Overview:

- **HW 1**:
  1. **Hodgkin-Huxley Model**: This assignment covers the Hodgkin-Huxley model and explores various aspects of it, including different external stimuli, N-V plot, and Firing Rate-I plot, among others. For detailed explanations, refer to the report in the HW1 directory.
  2. **Leaky Integrate-and-Fire Neuron Model**: In this task, we study both a basic and a more complex version of the Leaky Integrate-and-Fire model. This includes designing input current with Poisson distribution and incorporating inhibitory and excitatory inputs. Additional details can be found in the report located in the HW1 directory.

- **HW 2**:
  - **Part I**: FitzHugh-Nagumo Model
  - **Part II**: Winner-Takes-All Network

- **HW 3**:
  - Introduction to the analysis of the **Steinmetz dataset**
  - A theoretical question on **MAP and ML estimations**
  - Analysis of **stimulus-response power laws**

- **HW 4**:
  - Further exploration of the **Steinmetz dataset**
  - Questions related to **probability theory**, including Bayesian theory.
